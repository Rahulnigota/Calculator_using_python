Welcome to the GitHub repository for my Python Calculator project, which I developed during my internship at Bharat Intern! üéâ

**Project Overview:**
This project is a fully functional calculator built using Python. It offers basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with additional functionalities like handling decimal numbers and multiple operations in a single expression. The calculator provides a user-friendly interface and ensures accurate and reliable calculations.

**Key Features:**
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division operations
- Support for decimal numbers and complex expressions
- Easy-to-use interface for seamless user experience

**Internship Experience:**
During my time at Bharat Intern, I had the incredible opportunity to work on this project, which allowed me to put my Python programming skills to the test and enhance them further. The supportive and knowledgeable team at Bharat guided me throughout the development process, encouraging me to explore innovative solutions and best practices in software development.

**Learning Outcomes:**
This project has been instrumental in improving my problem-solving abilities, as well as my proficiency in Python programming. I gained valuable insights into coding efficiency, modularity, and documentation, which will undoubtedly benefit me in my future endeavors.

**Future Plans:**
As an open-source project, I intend to continue refining and expanding the calculator's functionalities. Feedback from the GitHub community is highly appreciated, and I look forward to collaborating with fellow developers to make this calculator even better.

**How to Contribute:**
Your contributions to this project are most welcome! Whether it's bug fixing, adding new features, or improving documentation, feel free to open issues or pull requests. Let's work together to create a valuable tool for the coding community!
